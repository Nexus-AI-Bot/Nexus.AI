 # Development Bot

This repository contains the development code for a bot that is currently in progress. The idea for this bot originated from a Hackathon. Our ultimate objective is to create a bot similar to YAGPDB.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a bot that can perform various tasks within the Discord platform. We aim to streamline and simplify processes that typically require multiple applications. By integrating these tasks into Discord, we aim to enhance user experience and efficiency.

## Credits

This project is a collaborative effort between myself and my friend. We work together to bring this bot to life.

We would also like to acknowledge the inspiration we draw from YAGPDB, a popular Discord bot. While we are creating our unique bot, YAGPDB serves as a reference and source of inspiration for our development process. You can find more information about YAGPDB [here](https://www.yagpdb.xyz).
